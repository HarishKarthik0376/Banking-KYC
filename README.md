You can watch our demo video [here]().

## Problem Statement 🛠️
Traditional KYC methods are primarily offline or non-interactive online, presenting challenges like manual processes, lack of user engagement, and inclusivity issues across languages and generations. Our aim is to create an intuitive and inclusive online Video KYC process that captures essential user details in a conversational manner.

## Solution 💪🏽
Our platform streamlines the Video KYC process using HTML, CSS, JS, and Firebase. It first gathers essential user details through an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can upload and capture their card details, including PAN card/Aadhaar, and the platform verifies this information for accuracy and validity.

## Future Scope 📈
-Implementing an AI-driven conversational flow to enhance user interaction and experience.

-Incorporating facial and signature authentication methods to strengthen security measures.

-Providing agent support throughout the KYC process to assist users when needed.

-Introducing read-aloud details with voice confirmation for accessibility and user convenience.

-Enhancing inclusivity with multiple language support, ensuring users from diverse backgrounds can easily navigate the platform.
